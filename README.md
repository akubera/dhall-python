# dhall-python

`dhall-python` contains (WIP) [Dhall][dhall-lang] bindings for Python using the [rust][dhall-rust] implementation.

Install using pip:

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user dhall
```

Supports Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (with libssl.so.1 and libcrypto.so.1)

## Usage

python-dhall implements a similar API to Python's [json
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html):

```python
>>> import dhall
>>> dhall.dumps({"keyA": 81, "keyB": True, "keyC": "value"})
'{ keyA = 81, keyB = True, keyC = "value" }'
>>> dhall.loads("""{ keyA = 81, keyB = True, keyC = "value" }""")
{'keyA': 81, 'keyB': True, 'keyC': 'value'}
```

## Developer guide

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for managing the development environment. If you don't have it installed, run

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
export PATH="$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH"
```

The project requires the `nightly` version of Rust.

Install it via `rustup`:

```
rustup install nightly
```

If you have already installed the `nightly` version, make sure it is up-to-date:

```
rustup update nightly
```

After that, you can compile the current version of dhall-python and execute all tests and benchmarks with the following commands:

```
make install
make test
make bench
```
